import torch

# Load model and tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("your-username/illuminator-4b")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("your-username/illuminator-4b")

# Generate text
prompt = "Explain quantum computing in simple terms:"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model.generate(
        inputs.input_ids,
        max_length=200,
        temperature=0.8,
        do_sample=True,
        top_p=0.9,
        pad_token_id=tokenizer.pad_token_id
    )

response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(response)
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# For conversational use
def generate_response(prompt, max_length=512):
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model.generate(
            inputs,
            max_length=max_length,
            temperature=0.7,
            do_sample=True,
