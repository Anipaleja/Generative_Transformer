            """Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI can be categorized into narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, and artificial general intelligence (AGI), which aims to match human cognitive abilities across all domains.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The core idea is to build algorithms that can receive input data and use statistical analysis to predict an output value within an acceptable range. Machine learning algorithms are trained using large amounts of data and are able to make accurate predictions or decisions by learning patterns in the data.

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data. Deep learning has revolutionized many fields including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. The key advantage of deep learning is its ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations of data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.

Neural Networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Each connection has a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. Neural networks can approximate complex non-linear functions and have been successfully applied to various machine learning tasks including classification, regression, and pattern recognition.""",

Its high-level built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development. Python's syntax emphasizes readability, which reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.

JavaScript is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and many also use it for server-side development through Node.js.

Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software. It involves the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Software engineering principles include modularity, abstraction, encapsulation, and separation of concerns. Modern software engineering practices emphasize agile methodologies, continuous integration, and test-driven development.""",

Unlike classical physics, quantum mechanics introduces concepts such as wave-particle duality, quantum entanglement, and the uncertainty principle. These phenomena occur because particles at the quantum level behave according to probability rather than deterministic laws.

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and accumulation of quantities. It consists of two main branches: differential calculus, which concerns instantaneous rates of change and slopes of curves, and integral calculus, which concerns accumulation of quantities and areas under curves. Calculus has applications in science, engineering, economics, and many other fields.

Evolution is the change in the heritable traits of biological populations over successive generations. Natural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. Evolution by natural selection is the process that explains the diversity of life on Earth and the apparent design in organisms.""",

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or interrupting normal business processes. Effective cybersecurity measures include firewalls, encryption, multi-factor authentication, and regular security updates.

Q: What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
A: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the web. HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is the secure version that encrypts data transmission using SSL/TLS protocols. HTTPS protects against eavesdropping and tampering, making it essential for secure communications like online banking and e-commerce.

Q: How do neural networks learn?
A: Neural networks learn through a process called backpropagation. They start with random weights, make predictions, calculate the error, and then adjust weights backward through the network to minimize error. This process is repeated many times with training data until the network can make accurate predictions."""
