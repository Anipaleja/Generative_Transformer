      "input": "Explain What is object-oriented programming",
      "output": "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. The four main principles of OOP are:\n\n1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class)\n2. **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing classes, inheriting their properties and methods\n3. **Polymorphism**: The ability of objects to take multiple forms and respond differently to the same method call\n4. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features\n\nOOP helps create more modular, reusable, and maintainable code by modeling real-world entities as objects with specific attributes and behaviors.",

      "input": "Explain How to use Python decorators",
      "output": "Python decorators are a powerful feature that allows you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or classes without permanently modifying their code. Here's how they work:\n\n```python\ndef my_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"Before function call\")\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        print(\"After function call\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@my_decorator\ndef greet(name):\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\ngreet(\"Alice\")  # Outputs: Before function call, Hello, Alice!, After function call\n```\n\nCommon use cases include logging, authentication, caching, and performance monitoring.",

      "input": "Explain JavaScript async await explained",
      "output": "Async/await is a JavaScript feature that makes working with asynchronous code more readable and easier to understand. It's built on top of Promises:\n\n```javascript\n// Traditional Promise chain\nfetchData()\n    .then(response => response.json())\n    .then(data => processData(data))\n    .catch(error => console.error(error));\n\n// Using async/await\nasync function handleData() {\n    try {\n        const response = await fetchData();\n        const data = await response.json();\n        processData(data);\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error(error);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nKey benefits:\n- More readable, synchronous-looking code\n- Better error handling with try/catch\n- Easier debugging and maintenance",

Query Optimization:**\n- Select only needed columns (avoid SELECT *)\n- Use WHERE clauses to filter early\n- Use LIMIT for large result sets\n- Avoid N+1 query problems\n\n**3. Database Design:**\n- Normalize appropriately (balance between normalization and performance)\n- Use appropriate data types\n- Consider partitioning for large tables\n\n**4. Analysis Tools:**\n- Use EXPLAIN to analyze query execution plans\n- Monitor slow query logs\n- Use database profiling tools\n\n**5. Caching:**\n- Implement query result caching\n- Use Redis or Memcached for frequently accessed data",
