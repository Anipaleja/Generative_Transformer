## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Dimension Mismatch Errors
If you encounter dimension mismatches:
```bash
python fixed_assistant.py  # Uses compatible model loading
```

#### Tokenizer Issues
The system automatically falls back to a simple tokenizer if the main one fails.

#### Memory Issues
Reduce model size or batch size:
```python
model = iLLuMinator(
    vocab_size=1000,
    n_embd=128,    # Reduced from 256
    n_head=4,      # Reduced from 8
    n_layer=3      # Reduced from 6
)
```

### Performance Optimization
- Use GPU if available: `model.to('cuda')`
- Reduce sequence length for faster inference
- Implement model quantization for deployment

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. **Custom Knowledge Sources**: Add documents to the knowledge base
2. **Enhanced Tokenization**: Implement subword tokenization
3. **Multi-turn Conversations**: Extend conversation memory
4. **Domain Specialization**: Fine-tune on domain-specific data

### Testing
```bash
# Run basic tests
python -c "from model.transformer import iLLuMinator; print('Model loads successfully')"

# Test generation
python generate.py
```
